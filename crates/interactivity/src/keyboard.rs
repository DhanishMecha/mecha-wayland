//! Keyboard input, protocol-agnostic and event-driven.
//!
//! Mirrors the contact path: `presentation` (or a test) reduces a
//! `wl_keyboard` event to one [`KeyboardInput`] signal, and this crate's
//! system turns it into a [`KeyPress`](crate::KeyPress), [`KeyRepeat`](crate::KeyRepeat)
//! or [`KeyRelease`](crate::KeyRelease) event at the node that holds the
//! keyboard focus — the same shape [`ContactInput`](crate::ContactInput)
//! takes to [`Press`](crate::Press)/[`Release`](crate::Release). No
//! polling, no per-frame deltas to clear: each report becomes one event
//! the focused node's handler runs.
//!
//! Focus is a [`KeyboardFocus`] resource: whatever owns it sets it with
//! [`KeyboardFocus::focus`] when a node gains the keyboard focus and
//! clears it with [`KeyboardFocus::blur`] when it loses it. A report
//! with no focus is dropped — a keyboard with nowhere to go is a no-op.
