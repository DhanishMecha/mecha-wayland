#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! Pointer, touch and keyboard input in, per-node events out.
//!
//! `interactivity` knows no compositor and no protocol: `presentation`
//! (or a test, until `presentation` exists) reduces `wl_pointer`,
//! `wl_touch` and `wl_keyboard` to two signals, [`ContactInput`] and
//! [`KeyboardInput`], and this crate turns those into per-node events:
//! [`Press`], [`Release`], [`Enter`], [`Exit`] and [`Clicked`] at the
//! nodes under a contact's position, and [`KeyPress`], [`KeyRepeat`],
//! [`KeyRelease`] at the node holding the keyboard focus.
//!
//! # Model — contacts
//!
//! - Every event dispatches deepest/frontmost-first, the contact's window
//!   last: a preorder walk's matches, reversed.
//! - [`Enter`]/[`Exit`] come from a fresh hit test on every `Moved`,
//!   independent of any capture in progress.
//! - [`Press`] locks in ("captures") the hit-set under the contact for
//!   that press; [`Release`] and [`Clicked`] route to that captured set,
//!   never to a fresh hit test, even if the contact moved in between.
//! - A `Touch` contact's state is torn down right after its `Released`
//!   (with a final `Exit` for whatever it is over at that point), since a
//!   finger has no idle position to keep hovering at. A `Mouse` contact's
//!   state persists across `Released` and keeps hovering.
//! - [`Clicked`] fires unconditionally alongside `Release`: there is
//!   no check that the contact is still within the captured set's bounds
//!   at release time.
//!
//! # Model — keyboard
//!
//! - [`KeyboardFocus`] is the node keyboard events dispatch to. Whatever
//!   owns that focus sets it with [`KeyboardFocus::focus`] and clears it
//!   with [`KeyboardFocus::blur`]. A report with no focus is dropped.
//! - [`KeyPress`], [`KeyRepeat`] and [`KeyRelease`] carry the key and the
//!   modifiers in effect; no polling, no per-frame deltas — one report
//!   becomes one event the focused node's handler runs.
