//! `Seat` is presentation's own state for this: the bound `wl_seat`, the
//! `wl_pointer`/`wl_touch` objects once requested, and (from later in
//! this file) the small bit of focus/position bookkeeping a reducer
//! needs that `interactivity::Contacts` cannot supply in time.
//! `App::signal` queues onto a list `App::flush` drains later, so a
//! `ContactInput` just sent has not reached `Contacts` yet when the next
//! protocol event for the same contact arrives.
